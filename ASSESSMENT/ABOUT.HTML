  <h2>What is Rush Hour?</h2>


  <div class="home">
  <p>When a Chinese consul's young daughter is kidnapped, Hong Kong Detective Lee
  must team up with Carter, a loud-mouthed LA detective. Distinctive work styles
  and cultural differences pose hiccups.</p>

  <p> Rush hour is a 1998 American buddy action comedy film directed by Brett Ratner and
     written by Jim Kouf and Ross LaManna from a story by LaManna. It stars Jackie
      Chan and Chris Tucker as mismatched police officers who are assigned to
      rescue a Chinese diplomat's abducted daughter. Tzi Ma, Tom Wilkinson,
      Ken Leung, Mark Rolston, Elizabeth Pe√±a, and Rex Linn play supporting roles.
       Released on September 18, 1998, the film grossed over $244 million
       worldwide. The film's box office commercial success led to two sequels:
        Rush Hour 2 (2001) and Rush Hour 3</p>
        <p>
Rush Hour is available to watch online via streaming services with subscriptions

<!--in this part of the home page,we can see a Div element being used. this is
used so that anything can be wrapped around and styled as a group rather than
individually styling in the CSS. Additonally, we can see that there is an
extra part of the div element code, labelled "class" this is so that when we style
in the CSS later on, it tells the browser that the styling codes should only be
applied to that specific Div  labelled class.
lastly, we can see a P element, this is simply used to add text or to start a new
paragraph within the website.-->

<!--as seen previously, we use an anchor reference to link an external website.
in this case we give the user a link to Netflix to either watch Rush hour 1 or 2.-->

<div class="video1">
<video controls width="80%" poster="IMAGE\rush hour.jfif">
<source src="VIDEO/rush hour trailer.mp4" type="video/mp4">
<p>sorry, your browser does not support the video element. You can download the video <a href="VIDEO/rush hour trailer.mp4">here</a>
  </p>
</video>
</div>
<!--in this section we can see some new coding elements being added in. in This
case, we see an element called video controls, poster, source and type. controls
allows the user to click play or pause the video which is basically a media
player. poster is used in this case as a thumbnail for the video as by default,
it shows the first frame of the video which looks unprofessional. this was added by
downloading an image into the image folder. Type is used to tell the browser what
type of format the video is in.
lastly, we can see a small text included at the end of the video file. this is done as it acts as a fallback
for people who use different web browsers as some do not support the video file
alternatively, it provides a link to the video to open elsewhere.-->
