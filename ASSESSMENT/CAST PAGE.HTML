<!--in this case, we can see a Section code being used. This is similar to the div class
element however it is referenced differently on the CSS page. similar to the video,
we can see that we are using an actual image as the main body here and instead of
having the type to show the format, images show 'Alt', this is labelled and used
to show the name of the picture if it needs styling in the CSS-->

ogg, wav, and mpeg files. These 3 format types are the main types of audio files
different web browsers can read. In a way, these are used as fallbacks as, if a website
was to open on another web browser it may not support one of the files, instead it will
open the next available/working audio file.-->
